# DiskUsageSorted
DiskUsageSorted or dus is like the Unix tool du but sorted!

Since I was tired of doing `du -sh somedir` and then cat the output to awk or other unix-tools in order to sort according to disk usage I just wrote myself DiskUsageSorted.

# Usage
```bash
$ dus -help
```

# Install
```bash
$ go get github.com/ichigo663/DiskUsageSorted
$ go install github.com/ichigo663/DiskUsageSorted
```
